                          INSTALLATION NOTES

Phemlock comes with a mk:defsystem style .system file. ASDF system
file hemlock.asd has been added, supporting SBCL for now. So when you
are lucky you just can fire up your Lisp and say

CMUCL/MK:
    ; (require 'defsystem)
    (mk:load-system :hemlock)

SBCL/ASDF:
    ; (require 'asdf)
    ; (require 'sb-bsd-sockets)
    ; (asdf:oos 'asdf:load-op :clx)
    (asdf:oos 'adsf:load-op :hemlock)

    (cl-user::hemlock)

If you want to try the CLIM backend, which not yet is fully operational, try:

    ; (load "../McCLIM/system.lisp")
    ; (mk:load-system :clim-clx) ; CMUCL/MK, might already be a dependency
    ; (asdf:oos 'asdf:load-op :clim-clx) ; SBCL/ASDF

    (clim-hemlock::clim-hemlock)


This was tested with:

 - CMUCL (with CLX library) using McCLIM
 - SBCL using McCLIM, CLX
 - ACL
 - CLISP using MIT CLX
