  "Make a window that displays text starting at the mark start.  The default
   action is to make the new window a proportion of the current window's height
   to make room for the new window.

   Proportion determines what proportion of the current window's height
   the new window will use.  The current window retains whatever space left
   after accommodating the new one.  The default is to split the current window
   in half.

   Modelinep specifies whether the window should display buffer modelines.

   Device is the Hemlock device to make the window on.  If it is nil, then
   the window is made on the same device as CURRENT-WINDOW.

   Window is an X window to be used with the Hemlock window.  The supplied
   window becomes the parent window for a new group of windows that behave
   in a stack orientation as windows do on the terminal.

   Font-Family is the font-family used for displaying text in the window.

   If Ask-User is non-nil, Hemlock prompts the user for missing X, Y, Width,
   and Height arguments to make a new group of windows that behave in a stack
   orientation as windows do on the terminal.  This occurs by invoking
   hi::*create-window-hook*.  X and Y are supplied as pixels, but Width and
   Height are supplied in characters."
