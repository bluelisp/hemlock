;; Now this is bogus: Both dis-line and window-dis-line use

;; Since there also is no constructor for dis-line they can't be
;; possibly created. I'll just do away with dis-line and just offer
;; window-dis-line.

;; Temporary workaround:
(deftype dis-line () 'window-dis-line)  ;make the tty code happy

;; FWIW, I think that the Allegro warning is permitted by the spec, but
;; does not indicate a problem.  The code was fine.  CLHS on defstruct
;; says:
;;
;;     Whether or not the :conc-name option is explicitly supplied, the
;;     following rule governs name conflicts of generated reader (or
;;     accessor) names: For any structure type S1 having a reader
;;     function named R for a slot named X1 that is inherited by another
;;     structure type S2 that would have a reader function with the same
;;     name R for a slot named X2, no definition for R is generated by
;;     the definition of S2; instead, the definition of R is inherited
;;     from the definition of S1. (In such a case, if X1 and X2 are
;;     different slots, the implementation might signal a style
;;     warning.)
;;
;; Should we revert to the old definition?  Would it make more sense to have
;; a subclass for each backend?
