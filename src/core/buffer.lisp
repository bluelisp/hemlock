;;;    Create the buffer "Main" and the mode "Fundamental".  We make a
;;; dummy fundamental mode before we make the buffer Main, because
;;; "make-buffer" wants fundamental to be defined when it is called, and we
;;; can't make the real fundamental mode until there is a current buffer
;;; because "defmode" wants to invoke it's mode definition hook.  Also,
;;; when creating the "Main" buffer, "Default Modeline Fields" is not yet
;;; defined, so we supply this argument to MAKE-BUFFER as nil.  This is
;;; fine since firing up the editor in a core must set the "Main" buffer's
;;; modeline according to this variable in case the user changed it in his
;;; init file.  After the main buffer is created we then define the real
;;; fundamental mode and bash it into the buffer.
