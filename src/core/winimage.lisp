;;; move-lines  --  Internal
;;;
;;;    This function is called by Maybe-Change-Window when it believes that
;;; a line needs to be inserted or deleted.  When called it finishes the
;;; image-update for the entire rest of the window.  Here and many other
;;; places the phrase "dis-line" is often used to mean a pointer into the
;;; window's list of dis-lines.
;;;
;;; Window - The window whose image needs to be updated.
;;; Changed - True if the first-changed line has already been set, if false
;;;  we must set it.
;;; String - The overhang string to be added to the beginning of the first
;;;  line image we build.  If no overhang then this is NIL.
;;; Underhang - The number of trailing chars of String to use.
;;; Line - The line at which we are to continue building the image.  This
;;;  may be NIL, in which case we are at the end of the buffer.
;;; Offset - The charpos within Line to continue at.
;;; Current - The dis-line which caused Maybe-Change-Window to choke; it
;;;  may be the-sentinel, it may not be the dummy line at head of the
;;;  window's dis-lines.  This is the dis-line at which Maybe-Change-Window
;;;  turns over control, it should not be one whose image it built.
;;; Trail - This is the dis-line which immediately precedes Current in the
;;;  dis-line list.  It may be the dummy dis-line, it may not be the sentinel.
;;; Width - (window-width window)

;;;    This macro is "Called" in update-window-image whenever it finds that
;;; the chars of the line and the dis-line don't match.  This may happen for
;;; several reasons:
;;;
;;; 1] The previous line was unchanged, but wrapped, so the dis-line-chars
;;; are nil.  In this case we just skip over the extension lines.
;;;
;;; 2] A line is changed but not moved; update the line noting whether the
;;; next line is moved because of this, and bugging out to Move-Lines if
;;; it is.
;;;
;;; 3] A line is deleted, off the top of the screen, or moved.  Bug out
;;; to Move-Lines.
;;;
;;;    There are two possible results, either we return NIL, and Line,
;;; Trail and Current are updated, or we return T, in which case
;;; Update-Window-Image should terminate immediately.  Changed is true
;;; if a changed line changed lines has been found.
