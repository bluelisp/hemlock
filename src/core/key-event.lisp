;;;       whether the X shift bit was set.
;;; For each button, pressed and released, we store a keysym to be used in a
;;; key-event representing the button and whether it was pressed or released.
;;; We also store a modifier name that TRANSLATE-MOUSE-KEY-EVENT turns on
;;; whenever a mouse event occurs with the X shift bit on.  This is basically
;;; an archaic feature since we now can specify key-events like the following:
;;;    #k"shift-leftdown"
;;; Previously we couldn't, so we mapped the shift bit to a bit we could
;;; talke about, such as super.
