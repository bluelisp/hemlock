;;; Each such instance of a thing that needs to be done is remembered be
;;; throwing needed information on a stack specific to the thing to be
;;; done.  We cannot do any of these things right away because each may
;;; confict with the previous.
;;;
;;; Each stack is represented by a simple-vector big enough to hold the
;;; worst-case number of entries and a pointer to the next free entry.  The
;;; pointers are local variables returned from COMPUTE-CHANGES and used by
;;; SMART-WINDOW-REDISPLAY.  Note that the order specified in these tuples
;;; is the order in which they were pushed.

;;; the stacks (up, down, erase, write, and rewrite) are returned.
;;;
;;; The algorithm is as follows:
;;; 1] If the line is moved-and-changed or new then throw the line on
;;; the write stack and increment the clear count.  Repeat until no more
;;; such lines are found.
;;; 2] If the line is moved then flush any pending clear, find how many
;;; consecutive lines are moved the same amount, and put the numbers
;;; on the correct move stack.
;;; 3] If the line is changed and unmoved throw it on a write stack.
;;; If a clear is pending throw it in the write stack and bump the clear
;;; count, otherwise throw it on the rewrite stack.
;;; 4] The line is unchanged, do nothing.
