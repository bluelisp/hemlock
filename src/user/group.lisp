;;; File group stuff for Hemlock.
;;; Written by Skef Wholey and Rob MacLachlan.
;;;
;;;    The "Compile Group" and "List Compile Group" commands in lispeval
;;;    also know about groups.
;;;
;;; This file provides Hemlock commands for manipulating groups of files
;;; that make up a larger system.  A file group is a set of files whose
;;; names are listed in some other file.  At any given time one group of
;;; files is the Active group.  The Select Group command makes a group the
;;; Active group, prompting for the name of a definition file if the group
;;; has not been selected before.  Once a group has been selected once, the
;;; name of the definition file associated with that group is retained.  If
;;; one wishes to change the name of the definition file after a group has
;;; been selected, one should call Select Group with a prefix argument.
