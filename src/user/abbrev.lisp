;;;; These Things are Here:

;;; C-X C-A    Add Mode Word Abbrev
;;;               Define a mode abbrev for the word before point.
;;; C-X +      Add Global Word Abbrev
;;;               Define a global abbrev for the word before point.
;;; C-X C-H    Inverse Add Mode Word Abbrev
;;;               Define expansion for mode abbrev before point.
;;; C-X -      Inverse Add Global Word Abbrev
;;;               Define expansion for global abbrev before point.
;;; Alt Space  Abbrev Expand Only
;;;               Expand abbrev without inserting anything.
;;; M-'        Word Abbrev Prefix Mark
;;;               Mark a prefix to be glued to an abbrev following.
;;; C-X U      Unexpand Last Word
;;;               Unexpands last abbrev or undoes C-X U.

;;; List Word Abbrevs                 Shows definitions of all word abbrevs.
;;; Edit Word Abbrevs                 Lets you edit the definition list directly.
;;; Read Word Abbrev File <filename>  Define word abbrevs from a definition file.
;;; Write Word Abbrev File            Make a definition file from current abbrevs.

;;; Make Word Abbrev <abbrev><expansion><mode> More General form of C-X C-A, etc.
;;; Delete All Word Abbrevs                      Wipes them all.
;;; Delete Mode Word Abbrev                      Kills all Mode abbrev.
;;; Delete Global Word Abbrev                    Kills all Global abbrev.

;;; Insert Word Abbrevs          Inserts a list of current definitions in the
;;;                                format that Define Word Abbrevs uses.
;;; Define Word Abbrevs          Defines set of abbrevs from a definition list in

;;; Word Abbrev Apropos <string> Shows definitions containing <string> in abbrev,
;;;                                definition, or mode.

;;; Append Incremental Word Abbrev File           Appends to a file changed abbrev
;;;                                                 definitions since last dumping.
