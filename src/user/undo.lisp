;;; the next time SAVE-FOR-UNDO is called.  Actually, the original undo and

;;;    not connected to any buffer.  A first undo deletes region, saving it and

;;;    region in the buffer and sets mark-or-region to be the deleted and saved

;;;    Region is not connected to any buffer.  Mark-or-region is a permanent
;;;    mark into a buffer where region is to be inserted on a first undo, and

;;;    deleted upon a subsequent undo.  The cleanup method knows mark-or-region

;;;    has marks into a buffer because if a subsequent undo does occur, region
