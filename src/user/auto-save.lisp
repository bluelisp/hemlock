;;; key stroke, the buffer-signature at the time of the last checkpoint, a count
;;; of the number of destructive keystrokes which have occured since the time of
;;; the last checkpoint, and the pathname used to write the last checkpoint.  It
;;; is generally kept in a buffer-local hvar called "Auto Save State".
