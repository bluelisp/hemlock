;;; We have "Keyboard Macro Transforms" that help in making a keyboard
;;; macro.  What they do is turn the sequence of commands into equivalent
;;; lisp code.  They operate under the following principles:
;;;
;;;    They are passed two arguments:
;;; 1] The command invoked.
;;; 2] A keyword, either :invoke, :start or :finish
;;;
;;;    If the keyword is :invoke, then the transform is expected to
;;; invoke the command and do whatever is necessary to make the same
;;; thing happen again when the macro is invoked.  The method does this
;;; by pushing forms on the list *current-kbdmac* and characters to
;;; simulate input of on *kbdmac-input*.  *current-kbdmac* is kept
;;; in reverse order.  Each form must be a function call, and none
;;; of the arguments are evaluated.  If the transform is unwound,
;;; presumably due to an error in the invoked command, then nothing
;;; should be done at invocation time.
;;;
;;;    If the keyword is :finish, then nothing need be done.  This
;;; is to facilitate compaction of repetitions of the same command
;;; into one call.  The transform is called with :finish when a run
;;; is broken.  Similarly, the transform is called with :start
;;; before the first occurrence in a run.
