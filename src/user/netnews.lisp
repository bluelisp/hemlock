;;; when the server is down Hemlock doesn't hang as I suspect it will.

;;; Warning:    Throughout this file, it may appear I should have bound
;;;             the nn-info-stream and nn-info-header-stream slots instead
;;;             of making multiple structure accesses.  This was done on
;;;             purpose because we don't find out if NNTP timed us out until
;;;             we make an attempt to execute another command.  This code
;;;             recovers by resetting the header-stream and stream slots in
;;;             the nn-info structure to new streams.  If the structure
;;;             access were not made again and NNTP had timed us out, we
;;;             would be making requests on a defunct stream.
